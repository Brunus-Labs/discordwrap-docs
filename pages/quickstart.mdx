# Installation

Install Discordwrap with 
```sh copy
pip install discordwrap
```
and your good to go!

## Quickstart

Discordwrap is a very, very simple library. Our goal is to not really need documentation ourselves.
All methods are named directly after their Discord API counterparts, and returns the same json the api returns.

```py copy
from discordwrap import Auth, channel

Auth.TOKEN = 'YOUR TOKEN'

# your channel
channel = 1234567890

message = channel.create_message(channel, json={
    'content': 'Hello world!'
})
```
